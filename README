# Krack-H by Yokai Seishinkage
A hash cracker that accepts sha1, sha256, sha384, sha512, and md5 hashes.

Hash cracking tool written in bash and ported to C.

## Installation ##

git clone https://github.com/Yokai-Seishinkage/Krack-H.git

cd Krack-H

chmod +x krack-H

## Dependencies ##

coreutils
bash version 4.3.42

## Usage ##

cd into Krack-H directory
chmod +x krack-H
./krack-H

Enter the hash you wish to crack including a double space and a dash "-" on the end.

(i.e. MD5 Hash for the word "password" would be: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99  - )
Then follow the directions as you are prompted.

## Notes ##

There is very little error correction. Most errors (such as user input errors) will
end the script and you will have to start over. Such is the nature of this beast.

Any issues report them asap. I will correct them as soon as I can.

This tool is written in bash and ported to C code. It is obviously not going to be as 
fast as a tool such as John the Ripper or Aircrack-ng. However, this tool works 
exceptionally fast with lighter wordlists (i.e. less than 500000 lines). Using a tool 
such as crunch, one can make small wordlists that are very specific and krack-H 
will speed right through them.
